# GCpu_OpticalFlow
This code is an accelerated open-source software for 2D optical flow estimation and mechanical strain.   
The code is based on D. Sun method with some improvements. 
## Requirements
There are two versions of the software: a CPU and a GPU version.
You will need Python 3 (3.6 or higher) with the following modules:  
**For the CPU version:**  
-[Numpy](https://numpy.org/) 1.20.3 or newer
-[Scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) 0.16.2  or newer
-[Scipy](https://scipy.org/) 1.6.3 or newer
**For the CPU version:**  
For the GPU version you will need beside [Numpy] (https://numpy.org/) some additionnal package
